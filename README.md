# What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

In this study I only learned basics.

Tools I used:
1. Prolog
2. Exsys
3. Exsys Corvid
4. Scilab/Matlab
