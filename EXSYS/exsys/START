                         LEARNING HOW TO USE EXSYS


The programs on this disk will teach you how to create your own expert
systems with EXSYS.  If you have not already done so you may wish to
run the demo expert systems on the RUNTIME disk.  To do this press
<CTRL><BREAK> to return to DOS, load the RUNTIME disk and enter LEARN.
The program will allow you to run four demo expert systems.  Each is
preceded by a short explanation of what the demo is intended to show.

After you finish with the demos, this disk will teach you how an EXSYS
knowledge base is created. A window will explain each step and the
program has been slowed down so you can see what is happening.  All you
have to do is press the space bar when prompted.  You do not have to input
any of the commands.  Once you have seen a knowledge base created, read
the manual as it provides information not found in this program.

Running this entire disk takes about 1 hour.
