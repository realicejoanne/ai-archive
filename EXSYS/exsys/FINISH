You should now read the EXSYS manual as it contains more information on the
capabilities of EXSYS.  You should then start by trying to generate a small
expert system on your own.  For a first project you might try a very simple
one that identifies the items on your desk.  If you have any problems using
the programs or if you have comments about the programs, contact EXSYS Inc.
